Constable Murphy was sipping a coffee when his portable radio crackled. ``10-72 in progress, 88 King's Road. All units standby.''
``Yis b'y!'', he exclaimed. ``That's Moo Moo's Ice Cream. I'd best get meself down there.''
He pushed his cup away and quickly hied to his patrol car. ``Suspect headed west on Pitts Memorial.''
