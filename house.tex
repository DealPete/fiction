''That button launches an airstrike.''
''It does what?'' Mark asked, not sure he had heard correctly.
''It launches an airstrike against the construction site. Don't press it.'' The foreman glared at him sternly, then continued his demonstration of the new machine.
''Any questions?'' he asked when he was done.
''I'm sorry, sir, I gots to ask. Why would I want to launch an airstrike against the site.'' This elicited a chuckle from the other workmen.
The foreman looked around nervously. ''I know what you're thinking son. Why would anyone put such a stunned-arsed button on a remote crane operation module? Well it don't matter how it got there. You press that and we all blow sky-high. So don't go touching it. Do I make myself clear?''
''Yes sir, very clear.''

''There's no way!'' declared Geoff. ''It's got to be a joke. Just think of the liability. I'm sure this would void their insurance too.''
''I'd make more sense if we were working on a top secret military project,'' Mark offered. ''Like the Death Star.''
Kurt suddenly walked up with a determined look on his face. He gasped the controls tightly with one hand and hovered a shaking finger over the button. ''B'ys, I'm pressing it! You can't stop me.''
''Don't do it!'' Goeff cried, grabbing his arm. ''
